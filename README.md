### Overview of the analysis:
#### W. Avy tells you that he's interested in the most active station; he believes it will provide the most data and help you determine the best location for the surf shop. However, we know that more data doesn't necessarily equate to more accurate results. But W. Avy is passionate about the locationâ€”he's convinced that it will provide the best weather for surfing and eating ice cream. For this reason, we provided him an anlysis with the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures of the most active station. Avy was very satisfied with our findings.
